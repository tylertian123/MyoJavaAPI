# Myo Java API
A JNI wrapper for the Myo Windows C++ API.

All methods, enums and other things from the C++ API have their corresponding Java counterparts, some with slight modifications
to account for language differences.

Documentation can be found under the top level `bin` directory, in the compressed `bin/doc.zip`.

Examples coming soon!
